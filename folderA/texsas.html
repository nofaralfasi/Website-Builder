                problematic with <br>
                differences in soils, topography, geology, rainfall, and plant and animal communities.[17] One classification system divides Texas, <br>
                in order from southeast to west, into the following: Gulf Coastal Plains, Interior Lowlands, Great Plains, and Basin and Range Province.</font>

                    The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable; <br>
                    it can be fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both. The vast geographic, economic,<br>
                    and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United
                    States
