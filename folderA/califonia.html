					   What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions<br>
					   throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta California in the larger territory <br>
					   of New Spain. Alta California became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but would later be ceded <br>

			       California's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west, to the Sierra Nevada in the east – from the Redwood–Douglas fir <br>
			       forests of the northwest, to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast. The center of the state is dominated by the Central Valley, a major <br>
			       agricultural area. California contains both the highest and lowest points in the contiguous United States (Mount Whitney and Death Valley)<br>
			      , and has the 3rd longest coastline of all states

					At least half of the fruit produced in the United States is now cultivated in California, and the state also leads in the production of <br>
					vegetables.[14] Other important contributors to the state's economy include aerospace, education, manufacturing, and high-tech <br>
					industry. If it were a country, California would be the 8th or 9th largest economy in the world and the 34th most populous.
