                    California is a state located on the West Coast of the United States. It is the most populous U.S.
                    state, home to one out of eight people<br>
                    who live in the U.S., with a total of 38 million people, and it is the third largest state by area
                    (after Alaska and Texas). California is<br>
                    bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east, Arizona to the southeast, and the Mexican state
                    of Baja California to the south.<br>
                    It is home to the nation's second and fifth most populous census statistical areas

                What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a
                number of European expeditions<br>
                throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta
                California in the larger territory <br>
                of New Spain. Alta California became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for
                independence, but would later be ceded <br>
                to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican-American War

                    California's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast in the west, to the Sierra Nevada in
                    the east � from the Redwood�Douglas fir <br>
                    forests of the northwest, to the Mojave Desert areas in the southeast. The center of the state is
                    dominated by the Central Valley, a major <br>
                    agricultural area. California contains both the highest and lowest points in the contiguous United
                    States (Mount Whitney and Death Valley)<br>
                    , and has the 3rd longest coastline of all states

                    At least half of the fruit produced in the United States is now cultivated in California, and the
                    state also leads in the production of <br>
                    vegetables.[14] Other important contributors to the state's economy include aerospace, education,
                    manufacturing, and high-tech <br>
                    industry. If it were a country, California would be the 8th or 9th largest economy in the world and
                    the 34th most populous.
