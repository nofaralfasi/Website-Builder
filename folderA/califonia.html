                What is now California was first settled by various Native American tribes before being explored by a number of European expeditions<br>
                throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. It was then claimed by the Spanish Empire as part of Alta California in the larger territory <br>
                of New Spain. Alta California became a part of Mexico in 1821 following its successful war for independence, but would later be ceded <br>
                to the United States in 1848 after the Mexican-American War
